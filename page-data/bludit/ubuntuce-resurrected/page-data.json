It started as an idea that I got from a satire distro called Jesux. I liked the idea of creating a distro that was based on one of the most popular Linux distros and have it pre-configured with Christian software. </p>\n<p>When I first started I had no idea what I was doing. In fact I was brand new to the world of Linux. However, I decided to go for it. The initial release caused quite a stir. I received a ton of backlash from people. Most of the people who didn't like the project objected to the concept of a Christian Linux distro. They really failed to understand the underlying concept that I was going for. There was also a lot of praise for the project. UbuntuCE was mentioned in several Linux magazines and even a few non-Linux ones.</p>\n<p>One of the features of UbuntuCE that got the most praise was the fact that it came with web content filtering pre-configured. Setting up a safe system for families can be very challenging. UbuntuCE tried to solve that.</p>\n<p>After several years my time became more limited with other projects on my plate. A few other folks jumped in and helped take up the mantle for a while, but ultimately UbuntuCE went dormant. I never let the site go down and always hoped to come back to it.</p>\n<p>Finally, after many years I have &quot;resurrected&quot; UbuntuCE. The concept is the same. I have based the latest release, code named &quot;Lazarus&quot;, on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I have added additional Bible Study software from the available repositories. I have also created an UbuntuCE Repository to house the UbuntuCE specific packages that I have built. These include a welcome app, wallpapers, etc.</p>\n<p>The latest release still comes with web content filtering pre-configured. This time I have taken a different approach and am using a combination of <a href=\"https://cleanbrowsing.org/\">CleanBrowsing</a> DNS or <a href=\"https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/#familyshield\">OpenDNS Family Shield</a> which can easily be configured using <a href=\"https://github.com/jeremehancock/dnsminder#readme\">DNS Minder</a>, and a new application that I built called <a href=\"https://github.com/mhancoc7/hostminder#readme\">Host Minder</a> that automatically blocks websites based on your preferred Protection Level.</p>\n<p>If you are interested you can check it out at <a href=\"https://ubuntuce.com\">UbuntuCE.com</a></p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ubuntuce-resurrected"}},
