I also didn't like that the <a href=\"/fold-for-covid\">BOINC Node</a> only had 2GBs of RAM. So I also decided to re-organize things a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>So here is what has changed.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"/node-red-twitter-bot\">Node-Red Node</a> switched with the Load Balancer Node in the Pi Lab Web Cluster</li>\n<li>The two Pi 4 4GBs from the Pi Lab Web Cluster were swapped with the <a href=\"/fold-for-covid\">BOINC Node</a> and <a href=\"/restreamer\">Resteamer Node</a></li>\n<li>I purchased three new Pi 2GBs to replace three of the Pi 2s in the Pi Lab Web Cluster</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now the Pi Lab Web Cluster is using all Pi 4 2GBs for all nodes</p>\n<p>I was very excited at how easy it was to move things around. I simply ran the following on each node before moving the SD card to ensure everything was the latest and greatest.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y</code></pre>\n<p>Other than having to update some port forwards and what not for IP changes that was it. </p>\n<p>For more details checkout the <a href=\"/specs\">Current Specs</a>.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pi-lab-upgrades"}},
