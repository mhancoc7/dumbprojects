The photos were taken between 1968 and 2008 and feature various roadside attractions in the United States. </p>\n<p>My first thought was I should build some sort of API to allow someone to easily use these photos on a website. So I built out a very simple API of sorts and set it up here, <a href=\"https://roadside-america.dumbprojects.com/\">Roadside America API</a>.</p>\n<p>I started tweeting the pictures on my personal Twitter account and people seemed to like them. So I have setup a Roadside America Twitter account and new site to allow people to get a random picture from the archive wiith its description every hour.</p>\n<p>Check it out here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RdSd_America_US\">@RdSd_America_US</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://roadsideamerica.us/\">RoadsideAmerica.us</a></p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"roadside-america"}},
