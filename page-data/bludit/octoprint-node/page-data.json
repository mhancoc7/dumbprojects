I have been wanting one for quite some time. It is an <a href=\"https://creality3d.shop/collections/3d-printer/products/creality3d-ender-3-pro-high-precision-3d-printer\">Ender 3 Pro</a>. I am really just getting into using it but one of the first things I was told to do was check out <a href=\"https://octoprint.org/\">OctoPrint</a>. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So what is OctoPrint?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is described as <em>&quot;The snappy web interface for your 3D printer.&quot;</em>.  That doesn't begin to explain how great I think it is. It definitely does provide a web interface for your 3D printer, but it does so much more. It also provides the ability to run manual commands and even select from a very nice selection of plugins for a variety of tasks. It truly made a nice 3D printer a much more enjoyable piece of equipment.</p>\n<p>I have re-purposed my <a href=\"pi-lab-monitor-node\">Monitor Node</a> into my new OctoPi Node. </p>\n<div class=\"centered\">\n    <img src=\"/bl-content/uploads/pages/b488323d86f5d481bf4bac8f975a2ca3/octoprint-node.png\" class=\"image-border\" /><br><br>\n</div>\n<p>So far I have mostly printed <a href=\"http://www.3dbenchy.com/\">3DBenchies</a> trying to really get my print quality dialed in. I have one functional print under my belt that I am very happy with. I have had issues with my Roomba getting stuck under our coach. So I went looking on <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com\">Thingverse</a> and I found this <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1756175\">Bumper Extension for Roomba</a>. It was for a different model and I had to do some scaling to make it large enough to keep my Roomba from going under the couch. So far it is working great!</p>\n<div class=\"centered\">\n    <img src=\"/bl-content/uploads/pages/b488323d86f5d481bf4bac8f975a2ca3/roomba-mod.png\" class=\"image-border\" /><br><br>\n</div>\n<p>I have added a new <a href=\"category/3d-printing\">3D Printing</a> category to the blog and I hope to be posting many more prints very soon.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"octoprint-node"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
